A Java-based wrapper for Livestreamer that offers a GUI to easily launch and resume streams. Anyone within the Dopelives community is free to develop this project further. Send Ezid a message on IRC for access. When contributing, please use the attached formatter style for consistency purposes and UTF-8 as the default character encoding.

Should be ran with VM arguments `-Dprism.dirtyopts=false` due to https://github.com/tvkanters/Dopestreamer/issues/38.

Special thanks to the Livestreamer devs at https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer
